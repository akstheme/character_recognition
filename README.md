# MNIST Character Recognition using Basic CNN Model

This MATLAB project demonstrates a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The script includes data preparation, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

## Features

- **Data Preparation**: Loads and splits the MNIST dataset into training and test sets.
- **Model Architecture**: Defines a basic CNN architecture with convolutional, ReLU, fully connected, softmax, and classification layers.
- **Training**: Trains the CNN on the training set with specified options.
- **Evaluation**: Classifies the test set and calculates the accuracy.
- **Visualization**: Plots the training loss and displays a confusion matrix.

## Requirements

- MATLAB (with Deep Learning Toolbox)
- MNIST dataset

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mnist-character-recognition.git
    cd mnist-character-recognition
    ```

2. Set the path to your MNIST dataset in the script.

3. Run the script in MATLAB to train the model and evaluate its performance.

## Results

- **Training Loss Plot**: Visualizes the loss during the training process.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Displays the classification performance on the test set.
